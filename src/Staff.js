                            Grace Bauer-Lubow is the mother of three children from Sulphur, Louisiana whose first exposure to the juvenile justice system came as the parent of a court-involved youth who, at age 14, was sent to the notorious Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth where he was abused and mistreated.  When it became clear that there was no system accountability for her son’s treatment, and nowhere to turn for help or redress of grievances, Grace became a passionate advocate for juvenile justice reform. Grace’s personal experiences with the juvenile justice system made her a dedicated advocate, organizer and an especially impassioned public speaker. </p>

                            <p> In November of 2011, Grace joined Zachary Norris to build Justice for Families (J4F).  J4F is the first national family-driven organization committed to ending the youth incarceration epidemic and the reinvestment of resources in youth, families and communities most impacted by our nations over-reliance on incarceration.   In her role at J4F, Grace has focused on creating a network to link families and their organizations, planning and building of a shared learning environment for families, leadership development of families and through reform of policy and practice, greater awareness of the critical need for family voice and power at all decision making points in the juvenile justice system.  After serving as the Executive Director of Justice For Families from 2013-2020, Grace became a Senior Associate to the Director.
