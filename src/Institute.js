    <Card.Text>
    <p>In 2012, J4F established the Family Leadership Institute (FLI). The Institute is a high impact leadership development and skill-building program that uses training, coaching and support. The Institute provides deeply impacted people with a unique opportunity to connect with others that share their determination and experiences; hear about victories, defeats and the lessons learned from those efforts; brainstorm ideas about their local work; share valuable connections and resources; and build strong peer-to-peer relationships that are relied upon for support, ideas and technical assistance.  J4F hosts the Institute at no cost to participants, several times each year, in different states.</p>
 
    <p>The J4F Family Leadership Network is comprised of over 300 families in 45 states!  The experience they coalesce around at J4F is one that has been deeply traumatic for them and for their families and one that is often ongoing when they begin to engage in leadership activities. Our work and activities are designed with this in mind and are implemented to reflect J4F's organizational commitment to racial, economic and gender justice and healing.</p>
      
    <p>Since 2012, 300 impacted individuals have attended the Institute. Over 90% of participants have returned to their communities to challenge oppressive systems and change policy, practice and the entrenched culture that underpins the current power structure through local grassroots organizations or as individual activists in places where there is no organizational support.</p>
