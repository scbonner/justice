Grace Bauer-Lubow is the mother of three children from Sulphur, Louisiana whose first exposure to the juvenile justice system came as the parent of a court-involved youth who, at age 14, was sent to the notorious Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth where he was abused and mistreated.  When it became clear that there was no system accountability for her son’s treatment, and nowhere to turn for help or redress of grievances, Grace became a passionate advocate for juvenile justice reform. Grace’s personal experiences with the juvenile justice system made her a dedicated advocate, organizer and an especially impassioned public speaker.
