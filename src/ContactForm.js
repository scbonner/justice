                                <p className="card-text">While this topic may seem too basic and not needed for most professionals, the content is presented in a distinctive manner meant to help participants make connections between their own families and the families they work with.  Defining family could be as easy as opening up a dictionary and reading the definition.  However, this type of learning doesn’t provide the participant with the opportunity to recognize the many facets of relationship building essential to “genuine and meaningful” engagement and partnership.  This session also provides research-based reasons why family engagements benefits systems, workforce and community safety as well as individual youth and family outcomes. </p>

                                    <p className="card-text">To achieve “genuine and meaningful” engagement and partnership with families, it is important to understand the big picture. Many professionals that work in child-serving agencies believe they engage families but there is an important difference between interacting, engaging and partnership. Participants will hear from families that have engaged and partnered with a juvenile justice agency and how that relationship helped families and ultimately, helped the agency achieve long sought-after reforms.

                                    <p className="card-text">Trauma can impact families, young people and staff. It also can be an invisible barrier that prevents “genuine and meaningful” engagement and partnership and healthy work environments. The sessions on trauma will give participants a comprehensive look at the different types of trauma, the manifestations of trauma in families and young people, how trauma may impact staff, and self-care strategies for dealing with their trauma and strategies they can share with young people and their families. The three-part series combines multiple learning styles with first-hand accounts that often resonate deeply with participants. Prior participants have described these sessions and the impact it had on their lives, both as professionals and individuals, as “complete personal transformations” and “life-changing perspectives.”

                                    <p className="card-text">Of all the challenges and dilemmas that folks like us might come together to discuss and debate, there is none as shamefully defining of our nation’s justice systems, nor as seemingly resistant to change, as the continued and, in many places, growing racial disparities.  We work in a system that—like so many human enterprises—suffers from numerous shortcomings.  The persistence of these problems, especially our dogged adherence to policies and practices that have proven ineffective and costly, or that have been discredited by research, or that have been exposed as routinely abusive, is difficult to understand without the lens of racial equity.</p>
                                    <p>To truly eliminate racial and ethnical disparities, all staff within an agency or organization need to understand the history of racism, implicit and explicit bias, and the impact racial and ethnic disparities have when trying to engage families and young people. </p>
