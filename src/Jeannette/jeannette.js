Jeannete was involved in parent advocacy and educational reform through her roles as public school volunteer, PTA President, Vice President, and secretary to community school district 10 presidents council. She worked as a full time Parent Involvement Coordinator at ASPIRA of NY, providing professional development for parents across the City of New York and program coordinator for EPIC (Every Person Influences Children).

<p>Jeannette took on the role of advocating for families with youth in the juvenile justice system based on her own difficult experiences as the parent of an incarcerated youth. She thrives to ensure that young people who have come in contact with the juvenile justice system are given a second chance to become productive members of their communities, and to provide families with the tools and resources to help their children succeed.</p>
